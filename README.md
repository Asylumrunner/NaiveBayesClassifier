# NaiveBayesClassifier
A cleaned-up, extended version of a Naive Bayes Classifier

## To-Do List:
* Allow the classifier to operate on .txt, .csv, and .json files. File type can be determined with regex, at which point the file name will be passed to distinct functions for processing. Depending on implementation, a class-based/interface-based set of services might save me some time.
* Allow the classifier to operate on ranges of numbers. Requires some reading for the best ways to divide ranges into meaningful groupings.
